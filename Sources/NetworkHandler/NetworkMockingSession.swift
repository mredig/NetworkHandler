extension NetworkMockingSession: Hashable {
	/// the logic here is that, since closures CANNOT be compared for equality, we instead have to compare this parent
	/// object for equality. The closure itself is a constant of `NetworkMockingSession` and cannot be changed once created.
	/// Following that logic, other constant properties do not need to be compared apart from the ID. Since there are a
	/// couple mutable properties, those also have to be compared for equality, which means this method needs updating
	/// whenever variable properties change on this struct. The catch with this approach is that if two `NetworkMockingSession`s are created identically, they will not equate to each other, but instead will only equate `true` when comparing copies of the same original. This approach should work fine for the purpose of storing in a collection and checking to confirm uniqueness.
